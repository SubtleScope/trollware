## Tested On
 - WindowsXP, Windows Server 2008 R2

## Notes
   - You need to provide your own media files for this script (Windows Boot Sound Replacements, etc.)
   - Must be run as an Administrator
   - By default, newer versions of Windows have blocks in place on sensitive system folders like "C:\Windows\Media"
   -- Need to find a way to override this,soboot sounds can be changed
